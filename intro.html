<h1><strong><em>BondMachine</em></strong></h1>
<h2><strong><em>a mouldable computer architecture</em></strong></h2>

<hr />

<p><strong>The BondMachine</strong> (BM) is a new kind of computer architecture radically different from the ones usually found in todayâ€™s computers.</p>

<p>The main feature of <strong>The BondMachine</strong> is that its processors forms an heterogeneous set of computing units where each of them can be configured and specialized to do a specific task implementing different architectures based on the specific problem.</p>

<p>Unlike standard architectures where software has to fit processors static constraints, within <strong>The BondMachine</strong> the architecture itself is build around the problem prior to creating the software. The result is a reduction of the gap between hardware and software.</p>

<p>BondMachines can be created in several ways: manually with its building tools, with a set of API that target specific problems and at last with a dedicated compiler that creates the architectures as part of the conversion of a source code to machine code.</p>

<p>BondMachines can be connected together with a custon ethernet protocol called <strong>etherbond</strong>. Distributed clusters of heterogeneous multicore can be built this way.</p>

<p>Ultimately the produced BondMachines can be simulated, used as computer applications or translated to RTL code and used in hardware (for example using FPGAs).</p>

<p>Strictly speaking <strong>The BondMachine</strong> is not only the architecture itself but also all the other technologies developed to make all of this possible. It is ultimately a <strong>computing ecosystem</strong> made of several components.</p>
